## Executive Summary

Synapse is a real-time messaging app with AI capabilities built for the MessageAI Gauntlet project. The core messaging infrastructure is **solid** (excellent real-time delivery, offline support, mobile lifecycle handling, and **dark mode support**). The primary gap is the **complete absence of AI features** (0/30 points) and **missing required deliverables** (-30 points penalty).

**Path to A Grade:**
1. Implement 5 required AI features + 1 advanced capability ‚Üí +30 pts
2. Complete all deliverables (video, brainlift, social post) ‚Üí +30 pts (remove penalty)
3. Polish group chat UI ‚Üí +4-6 pts
4. Add innovation features ‚Üí +3 pts potential

# Synapse - Persona Brainlift

## Chosen Persona: Remote Team Professional

**Who:** Software engineers, product managers, designers working in distributed teams

**Pain Points:**
1. **Information Overload:** 100+ messages per day across multiple channels
2. **Context Switching:** Hard to catch up after being away from conversation
3. **Lost Action Items:** Commitments get buried in chat history
4. **Search Frustration:** Can't find that important decision from last week
5. **Meeting Prep Time:** Manually reviewing conversations before sync meetings

## AI Features ‚Üí Pain Point Mapping

| AI Feature | Solves Pain Point | How It Helps |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| Smart Reply | Information Overload | Quick responses without typing, 50% faster replies |
| Thread Summary | Context Switching | 5-minute catch-up becomes 30 seconds |
| Action Items | Lost Commitments | Automatic todo tracking, never miss a deadline |
| Priority Detection | Information Overload | Focus on urgent messages first, ignore noise |
| Smart Search | Search Frustration | Find "that decision" in seconds with natural language |

## Advanced AI: Meeting Prep Agent

**Problem:** Engineers spend 15-30 minutes before each meeting reviewing Slack/email

**Solution:** Multi-step agent that:
1. Summarizes relevant conversations
2. Extracts your action items
3. Lists unresolved questions
4. Drafts meeting agenda

**Impact:** Reduces prep time from 20 minutes to 2 minutes (10x improvement)

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **RAG Pipeline:** Vectorize last 20 messages for context-aware AI
2. **Firebase + OpenAI:** Real-time messaging + powerful language model
3. **LangGraph:** Multi-step agent with proper error handling
4. **Mobile-First:** Native Android for best performance

## Risk Management

### **High Risks**

1. **AI Feature Quality:**
   - **Risk:** Features work but accuracy <80%
   - **Mitigation:** Test with real conversations, iterate prompts, use GPT-4 (not 3.5)

2. **Time Constraint:**
   - **Risk:** Not enough time to implement all features
   - **Mitigation:** Prioritize core features first, cut scope if needed (5 features > 4 excellent features)

3. **LangGraph Complexity:**
   - **Risk:** Multi-step agent too complex to implement
   - **Mitigation:** Start simple (3 steps), expand if time allows, fallback to simpler "Proactive Assistant" if blocked

### **Medium Risks**

4. **API Costs:**
   - **Risk:** OpenAI usage exceeds budget
   - **Mitigation:** Cache responses, use GPT-3.5-turbo for simple tasks, rate limit users

5. **Demo Video Quality:**
   - **Risk:** Poor audio/video quality
   - **Mitigation:** Use good microphone, record in quiet room, test recording setup first
